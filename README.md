# Prismatic HTGR Fuel Block Depletion Analysis with Minor Actinides

This repository contains my Monte Carlo simulation code, developed from scratch, for the depletion analysis of a prismatic High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) fuel block.

## Project Overview

The study explores an innovative approach to manage the initial excess reactivity in HTGRs by incorporating minor actinides (MAs) into the fuel composition of TRISO particles. This repository shows to analyze the depletion behavior of the fuel block and assess the effectiveness of this approach.

## Key Features

* **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Implements a Prismatic HTGR-3500Mw_th on OpenMC Monte Carlo code for detailed neutron transport and depletion calculations.
* **Prismatic HTGR Geometry:** Models the specific geometry of a prismatic HTGR fuel block.
* **TRISO Particle Fuel:** Accurately represents the complex structure of TRISO fuel particles within the simulation.
* **Minor Actinide Incorporation:** Examines the impact of varying minor actinide content within the fuel matrix.
* **Depletion Analysis:** Tracks changes in fuel composition, reactivity, and other key parameters over time.
* **From-Scratch Development:** The simulation code was developed from the ground up, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying physics and numerical methods.
* **Fuel Block Depletion:** Focuses on the depletion analysis of a single fuel block.
